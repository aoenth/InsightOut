# InsightOut

InsightOut is an iOS app created by GitHub users @aoenth, @vincentbanguyen, @trackjoy, @HaotianHuang and @UMPUSTEN as part of the SwiftUIJam hackathon in 2021. The app allows users to input their mood throughout the day using a wheel-like interface. Over time, users can see their mood for the past months in a beautiful, natively rendered graph.

## Installation

To run the InsightOut app, you will need to have Xcode 12 or later installed on your Mac. Once you have Xcode installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aoenth/InsightOut.git
```

Then, open the `InsightOut.xcodeproj` file in Xcode and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.

## Usage

When you open the InsightOut app, you will be taken to the home screen where you can input your mood for the current day using the wheel-like interface. You can swipe left or right to select the mood that best represents how you feel.

Once you have selected your mood, tap the "Save" button to save your mood for the day. You can then view your mood for the past months by tapping the "History" button on the home screen.

On the history screen, you can see your mood for the past months in a beautiful, natively rendered graph. You can also tap on a specific month to see your mood for each day of that month.
